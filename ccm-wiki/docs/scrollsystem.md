\## Scrolls



\- Most are used by putting them into a companion's order slot briefly. They do not need to stay.

\- You can safely retrieve the scroll and re-use it for other companions.

\- You  can copy a scroll into an empty one

\- Collection scrolls may be combined to add their collection spots

\- Delivery scrolls may likewise be combined.

\- All scrolls can be reset via white dye + black dye + the scroll.

(Note: some already offer reset via click actions)

\- Empty scrolls are crafted via an empty paper + the regal scepter (not consumed in the process)
