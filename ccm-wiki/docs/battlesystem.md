\## Part 1. Creating Soldiers



\- Assign job "Soldier" and put Job scroll briefly in order slot

\- Assign a Patrol Scroll (in peace time), and it will protect around these.

\- Hint: select groups of soldiers with control scroll

\- After selection, there are 4 modes you can select by writing in chat:

 	\* worknight -> Will sleep during day, patrol at night.

 	\* workday -> Default.

 	\* summonhere -> Will come to lord's hall, ignore all else.

 	\* towar -> War mode. Will ignore all other duties, will not 	return home to sleep, nor perform any patrolling. Will eat 	if not actively fighting, but not retrieve food or water.

 	Warning! Keep your soldiers supplied during campaigns.

\- Assign Soldier TYPE by selecting a group of soldiers and write:

 	\* setinfantry -> Default.

 	\* setarchers

 	\* setcavalry

 	\* sethorserarcher





\## Part 2. Battle System

\- Press key § to open/close battle menu

\- F1->F4 to command Infantry->Horse archers

\- View shown menu for available commands.

Note: Charge scans 200 blocks ahead for groups of enemies, will 	randomly select an enemy from closest group of enemies for each soldier.



Keep in mind! Ranged units need arrows.

This mod supports lances from Epic Knights. If a mounted soldier holds a lance and is ordered to charge, they will switch between running away and charging at their enemy appropriately.
