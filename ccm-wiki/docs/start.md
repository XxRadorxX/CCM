\## Getting started:

* You have two options
* A: Defeat five waves of enemies summoned with the holy cup
* B: Find a village/merchant and trade for the necessary 3 regal items, and other scrolls.
* (C: ask a friend)





\##Option A:

* Craft the holy cup using 3 diamonds, 1 gold block, 5 emeralds.

| DIAMOND    | GOLD\_BLOCK | DIAMOND    |

| EMERALD    | DIAMOND    | EMERALD    |

| EMERALD    | EMERALD    | EMERALD    |



* Throw it into fire to summon the hordes (explodes)
* Next defeat 5 waves of enemies to win full starter kit for town

&nbsp;	- ... including a wave of angry llamas.

&nbsp;	- Hint #1: Avoid a fort with 1-block thin walls, the 	creepers in the horde are smarter than others. Also have 	fortifications to hide behind, skeletons fire aggressively.

&nbsp;	- Hint #2: launch this during daytime and not when it's 	raining, if you wish to survive

&nbsp;	- Hint #3: they will attack animals, lock them up safe

&nbsp;	- Hint #4: shield ready and run after dropping the holy 	cup in fire





\##Option B:

* You will need an expert toolsmith and 20 blocks of emerald to get the 3 royal items.
