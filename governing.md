\## Governing



\- To create a town you need a Town key item.

\- It's also highly recommended to create a Town map

\- It's also highly advisable to craft a Lordhall scroll.



The town key cannot be crafted.

Must be bought from expert toolsmith at a price of 2 emerald blocks, or won by defeating the hordes of the holy cup.



Town Map:

Crafted from 1 empty map + 1 item frame + 1 town key item (not consumed) + 1 royal scepter (not consumed).





\## Creating the town

\- Use the key as per instructions

\- Keep it safe after creation (do not leave it to anyone else!)

\- Overview and plan your town with the town map

\- Select a position for the lord's hall, where companions will come to petition you with their issues.



Note! Without a lord's hall, companions may become inactive or die.





\## Resolving petitions

Shift + right-click with the scepter twice (follow-unfollow), and they are released. Will not come back complaining today.





\## After creation, basic housing.

\- Requires two items: house scroll and house food ledger scroll.

&nbsp;	Most crucial is food ledger scroll, at the bare minimum even 	homeless citizens can use assigned chests/cauldrons for food 	and water.

\- Beds are automatically calculated. '

\- Non food/-water i.e. "regular" storage chests are also automatic.

\- Home plots are automatically assigned and drawn on town maps
